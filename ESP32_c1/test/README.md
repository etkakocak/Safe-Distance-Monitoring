# Test Files

This folder contains early-stage test scripts used during the hardware setup and verification phase of the project.  

These files were created to test and calibrate hardware before full integration into the main system.  

⚠️ **Note:**  
These scripts are **not part of the final system architecture** and are **not called or referenced** by the actual application code.  
They are preserved here to provide insight into the development process and to document initial experimentation.  

We decided to keep this folder for transparency and future reference.
